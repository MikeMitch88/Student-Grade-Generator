Student 

Description:

The Student Grade Generator program is a JavaScript application that prompts the user to input student marks and then outputs the corresponding grade based on the marks. The program defines grade ranges as follows:

A: 80 and above
B: 60 to 79
C: 50 to 59
D: 40 to 49
E: Below 40
The program ensures that the input marks are between 0 and 100. If the input is invalid, it displays an error message.
